#+TITLE: SecureQ8 -- Tools for running secure quantized models

Small set of scripts that can be used to prep a model and input for evaluation
with [[https://github.com/data61/MP-SPDZ/][MP-SPDZ]].

The scripts require Google flatbuffers and the schema for ~.tflite~
models. Refer to ~build.sh~ for instructions/guide on how to install
these. Alternatively, running

: $ ./build.sh all

should do the trick on most systems.

The code works with all MobileNetV1 models, and compatible versions can be
downloaded [[https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/hosted_models][here]].

The ~images~ folder contains a couple of example images that can be used as
inputs.
